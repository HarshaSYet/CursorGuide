# Overview

This rule enforces **core clean code and software design principles** for TypeScript files.  
Focus is on simplicity, readability, maintainability, and correct structure. Apply when writing or refactoring `.ts` code.

## Key Principles

### 1. SOLID
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle — one responsibility per class/module  
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle — open for extension, closed for modification  
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle — subtypes replace base types safely  
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle — prefer many small interfaces  
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle — depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### 2. Higher-Level Guidelines
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple — avoid unnecessary complexity  
- **DRY**: Don’t Repeat Yourself — abstract repeated logic  
- **YAGNI**: You Aren’t Gonna Need It — implement features only when necessary  
- **Composition over Inheritance** — favor composing small units over deep inheritance chains

### 3. TypeScript-Specific Rules
- Prefer explicit types over `any`  
- Limit function parameters to ≤ 3 when possible  
- Keep functions short and focused  
- Use early returns to reduce nesting  
- Descriptive, consistent naming (`camelCase` for vars/functions, `PascalCase` for types/classes)
